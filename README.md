# Project Variant 3 - Photo Studio

A photo studio needs a system to manage customer orders for photo printing and film developing. Currently, orders are handled manually, which can lead to confusion and lost paperwork. This project will create a simple management system where receptionists take orders, photographers process them, and the system tracks materials used and calculates prices. Express orders cost 25% more, and the system will generate daily reports showing completed work and revenue. The goal is to replace paper-based processes with a digital system that keeps track of everything in one place.Retry
